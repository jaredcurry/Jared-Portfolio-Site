          Is a fin-tech application that allows users to link bank accounts, create saving goals for big expenditures, and view their finances in a dashboard.
          Basing my approach on User Centered Design principles, I created user flows, did user testing and designed the app for mobile and tablets.

          <h4>The Five W's</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Who: This tool is for people who want to save money, quickly, for a particular reason. The users are not new to technology but do not like working with their finances.</li>
            <li>What: A mobile app allowing all data on income and expenses to be recorded easily, on the go, and from a variety of devices. The tool displays data on the user’s finances.</li>
            <li>When: Users will utilize the tool in the period before a planned expense. During this period, they will input data when spending and receiving money so they can view accurate information on their finances.</li>
            <li>Where: The tool can be used from anywhere and using any device to ensure income and outgoings are easily recorded.</li>
            <li>Why: Saving money can be really hard, especially when you don’t have a long time to do so.</li>

            Creating a simple path for users to achieve their goals was a primary focus when designing Koin.
            As shown in the user flow, which was fine tuned through user testing, I was able to remove screens
            and move others to make sure users were able to complete their goals.

            In the first version, users had a hard time figuring out what they were supposed to do. Did the app automatically select all their accounts, what if they only wanted to choose one? In the second version I added a check box and changed the color of selected accounts to give a better visual indication for the user.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moved the add another bank account screen to the end of the flow, this way it doesn’t interrupt the user adding their main account and gives them the opportunity to add a secondary or just go right to the home page.
          </p>
          <p>
            I removed the notifications screen from user flow, users will be given the option of allowing notifications on the home screen after they sign up. I added a FaceID/TouchID toggle to the sign up screen, removing the FaceID/TouchID screen from the on boarding process, allowing for a faster sign up.

            I made a couple of changes to the home screen, first I cleaned up the goals section, cut down on wording to make it more simple and added % to show how far along a user was in their pursuit of a goal. I also changed the coloring, one user mentioned it was kind of hard on their eyes, so i asked a couple of people to take a quick look and they agreed.

          <p>
          Added a tab bar to allow users to change between different time frames. This was a great comment from one of the testers. Giving users the ability to see finances over different time frames is very helpful.E

          <h5>How I Work</h5>
          <p>
            This project started with a brief outlining specifics for what the project needed to entail. Provided to me in the project brief was the project's objective, the 5 W's, multiple user stories to choose from, partial branding guidelines, and the project's deliverables.

            I start by working through the project brief, making notes and highlights of important information, and then select user stories that would help me create a foundation for my application.

            I like to start with sketches, even though they end up a little messy; this process allows me to get ideas down on paper and to iterate on good ideas and throw out bad ones.

            Moving from sketching to low fidelity wireframes always excites me. It's at this point I can start to see how the project might take shape.  This becomes more clear when moving to mid-fidelity wireframes, adding content and colors to the app, and moving into user testing.

            User testing comes next. As I continue to grow my appreciation for the user testing process has too. Putting your unfinished app in front of users is always a little nerve-wracking but the insights gathered from the process are important.

            A design is never finished, but the high fidelity part and the production app version come next and it feels good when you get here. Even though I am constantly making little changes here and there, going back to users for insights, having a finished product is a satisfying feeling.

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            Thank you for taking the time to look at my case study into Koin. I enjoyed the process of talking with users, finding fixes to my early designs,
            and making a better experience for users. Money is a very personal and important aspect of people's lives and building something to help, was very fulfilling.
